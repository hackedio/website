You're an enthusiastic lot, aren't you? Ten days ago we released the initial batch of 200 HACKED tickets. We did our best to promote the event and the ticket release, but even then we couldn't predict how keen you all were; all 200 tickets were snapped up within 4 minutes. 

4 freakin' minutes. WOW! 

Since then we've gotten a lot of replies, real life requests and hints of bribes* from those of you that haven't managed to get a ticket yet. Don't despair, we will be releasing more tickets in the upcoming weeks. In fact, the next (smaller) batch of tickets will be live next week at 8:00am (yep, that's 8 in the morning) on Tuesday the 14th of May.

So why release tickets this way? Why not release them all in one go? Well, there are multiple reasons...

For starters, we've got over a thousand people signed up to our mailing list and we want to give everyone a fair chance in getting a ticket. Releasing the tickets at different times and days will give everyone interested a chance of getting a ticket. Besides that, some of the tickets still need to be allocated to people involved in running the event, like volunteers, sponsors, press and speakers. Finally, we admit, it also doesn't hurt to be talked about. The more interest we can generate in the event, without spending money on marketing, the more value we offer our great sponsors and only with their help can we produce the best event possible.

So get your itchy trigger fingers ready for Tuesday the 14th! BTW if you're interested in the other events we run, there are still tickets available for BarCamp Berkshire 2 (15th/16th June).

\*The HACKED Team will in no circumstances accept bribes. Unless ponies are involved. Or zeppelins.
