Over the past two weeks we have had many long meetings, several heated games of rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock and moved around lots of chairs to try to squeeze as many of you as possible into our HACKED venue!

The outcome is we have decided to release the final batch of tickets on Wednesday 12th June at 1pm. As this is the final release of tickets we will be opening the waiting list immediately after the tickets have sold out.

The exact process for the waiting list will be announced in early July. We hope it will allow an extra 50-100 people to attend HACKED as tickets are returned from cancellations, unused sponsor allocations, etc.

So set a reminder in your calendar, and we hope to see many of you at HACKED.
