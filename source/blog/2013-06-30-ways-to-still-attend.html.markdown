It's now just under 3 weeks until HACKED, and we know some of you have not got a ticket yet. There are still two ways to attend HACKED!

**The Waiting List**
 
Early this week we'll start asking people who can no longer attend to return their ticket; this means we will be able to release tickets to those of you who are on the waiting list. If you are not on the list, the chance of you getting a ticket is zero!
 
To join the waiting list head over to: [http://hacked.io/waitinglist/](http://hacked.io/waitinglist/) and add your details.
 
**Volunteering**
 
We still need some volunteers to help with registration, help desk and running the snack bar. You can signup to volunteer here:

Volunteers will get the chance to hack, as well as being part of the team running the biggest hackday in recent history!
