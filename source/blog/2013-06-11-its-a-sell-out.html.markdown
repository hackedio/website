In an amazing time of [INSERT TIME] minutes you all snapped up the final 200 hundred tickets! Now if you did not get a ticket theirs 
still a chance you can come to HACKED. We have now launched the waiting list which is available on the <a href="/waitlist">wait list</a> page.

**How will it work?**

From early July we will start asking people who can't make HACKED to return their tickets. From this pool we randomly allocate these tickets to those on the waiting list. If you are lucky enough to receive one of these tickets you will have a 24 hour window in which to complete your sign-up. If you miss the 24 hour windows the ticket will be reallocated to someone else on the list.

We hope to see many of you at HACKED next month!
