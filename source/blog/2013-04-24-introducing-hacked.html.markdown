Last Friday we stood in IndigO2, a venue that has previously hosted acts including The Who, Penn & Teller and David Essex and today after over a year since we started the planning process we are thrilled to announce HACKED will be taking place on July 20th and 21st.

We will provide you and 499 other developers, designers, hardware hackers and tinkerers with inspiring talks, tasty food and a fantastic venue; we're hoping you'll bring along some amazing ideas, make new friends and build some really great projects.

The first round of tickets are being released tomorrow (Friday 26th) at 12pm on the tickets page. More tickets will become available as we get closer to HACKED so if you're not successful, subscribe for updates on future releases.
