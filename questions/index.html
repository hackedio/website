  <h1>Questions &amp; Answers</h1>

  <!-- What -->
  <h2>What is HACKED?</h2>
  <p>HACKED is a free-to-attend, intense weekend of learning, sharing and building cool stuff. Whether you are a beginner
  or an expert, developer or designer, join us for what we guarantee will be a memorable experience.</p>

  <p>Hacking is all about playing with technology and using it in new and creative ways. We're not talking about building
  battle-hardened products - many of the more memorable hacks from similar events have been pulled off thanks to
  crossed fingers and lots of sticky tape!</p>

  <p>If you have ever been to a hack day before, you'll know the fun of making new things quickly, experimenting and
  collaborating with people from all sorts of backgrounds and levels of experience.</p>

  <p>Lots of companies are getting involved in HACKED and they are going to make their APIs and products available.
  There will be plenty of hands-on sessions and one-to-one help, so don't be scared about getting involved!</p>

  <!-- Where -->
  <h2>Where and when is HACKED?</h2>
  <p>We will be taking over <a href="http://www.theo2.co.uk/indigo2/index.html">IndigO2</a>, inside
  <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/AAw73">The O2</a> in London on July 20th and 21st 2013.</p>

  <!-- Who -->
  <h2>Who is running HACKED?</h2>
  <p>HACKED is being organised by The Lab which is part of O2 with the support of Geeks of London.</p>

  <!-- Can I give a talk? -->
  <h2>Can I give a talk?</h2>
  <p>Yes! During May and June we will open up our call for proposals for you to submit an idea.</p>

  <!-- Tickets -->
  <h2>How do I get a ticket?</h2>
  <p>Tickets to HACKED are now sold-out. We encourage you to join the <a href="/waitinglist">waiting list</a> for the best chance to still attend HACKED.</p>

  <!-- Tickets (international)-->
  <h2>I have a great distance and many borders to cross?</h2>
  <p>If you are planning to come from far away (another country, planet or dimension!) and tickets are not available
    please drop an email to <a href="mailto:help@hacked.io">help@hacked.io</a>. We will do our best to accommodate you!</p>

  <!-- Visas and other papers -->
  <h2>Can you provide visa letters?</h2>
  <p>Sadly we are unable to provide any bespoke letters or paperwork for visas. if you're unsure if you need a visa to travel to the
    United Kingdom you should speak to your local British Consulate or check <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">FCO.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <!--Look too young?-->
  <h2>I am under 18 can I attend?</h2>
  <p>If you are between the age of 16 and 18, you can attend HACKED. However you can't stay with us overnight so please plan to head home by 8pm. Attendees under the age of 16 must be accompanied by a parent or another responsible adult and get written approval from the organisers.</p>

  <p>If you are planning to come from far away (another country, planet or dimension!),
  <!-- O2 roof in use (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VzrtdNecBI) illegally parked spaceships will be towed -->
  drop an email to <a href="mailto:help@hacked.io">help@hacked.io</a> and we will do our best to help.</p>

  <!-- For Mr. Duck and his soldering iron -->
  <h2>What about hardware hacks?</h2>
  <p>Yes, they are more than welcome at HACKED! However, if you are planning something more than light soldering please get in touch.</p>

  <!-- Overnight -->
  <h2>Can I stay overnight?</h2>
  <p>Yes, you are more than welcome to bring your sleeping bag! Alternatively, there are plenty of <a href="/venue">hotels and guest houses</a> nearby.</p>


  <!-- Become a HackMaker -->
  <!-- (Uniform design to be determined) -->
  <h2>Can I volunteer or help out?</h2>
  <p>Yes, we are currently looking for volunteer "HackMakers" (sort of like the Olympics had GamesMakers&mdash; although we can't promise you'll meet the programming equivalent of Tom Daley). If you're interested drop us an email <a href="mailto:help@hacked.io">help@hacked.io</a> and include details about your special powers..</p>
